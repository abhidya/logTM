# logTM
A turing machine to solve logarithmic calcuations

# Constraints:

n >= 1
k is an integer equal to the log base 2 of a number. if the log base 2 of a number contains a fraction, then k is rounded up to the next whole number. 


# Input:
log(n)

# Output:
k


process:

1. base10-unary.txt

input: log(n), (n being a positive whole number greater than 0),  ie ("log(3)")

output: 0<sub>n</sub><sup>i</sup>    (unary conversion, ie ("000")
